## Introduction

This file will describe the xml of the vpd template file format used to
describe the contents of a VPD image

## High Level Description

The template VPD format is XML, used to describe the contents of a binary VPD image.  The template file is fed into createVpd.py.  It in turn interprets that XML, error checks it and creates a binary VPD image.

The template consists of 3 levels
* `<vpd>` - information about the overall VPD image
* `<record>` - information about a record in `<vpd>`
* `<keyword>` - information about a keyword contained in a `<record>`

The XML Hierarchy looks like the following:
``` xml
<vpd>
  <record>
    <keyword>
    </keyword>
    <keyword>
    </keyword>
  </record>
  <record>
    <keyword>
    ..
  </record>
  <record>
  ..
</vpd>
```

## `<vpd>`
This section covers the required tags in the <vpd> section of the template description
 
The top level `<vpd>` tag is required in all template files, whether it is a top level manifest description of a full image or simply a record level description.  The tag requirements in the <vpd> section depend upon usage.

### Tags included in the `<vpd>` section
`<name></name>`  
Used to define the output name of the files created by the tool.  This information is not stuck into the binary VPD image.

If the special name of FILENAME is given, then the name of the top level manifest file will be used for the name on any output files.

Can be used only once in the top level description  
Cannot be included in single record definitions  

`<size></size>`  
Used to define the maximum size of the binary image.  If the create image will exceede this size, an error is generated by the tool.

Can be used only once in the top level description  
Cannot be included in single record definitions  

`<VD></VD>`  
The hex value to be stuck in for the VD keyword in the VHDR

Can be used only once in the top level description  
Cannot be included in single record definitions  

``` xml
<record>
  ..
</record>
```
Defines the creation of a record within VPD.  Please see the section on the `<record>` tag for more information on valid fields and syntax

When creating a top level VPD template, at least 1 `<record>` must be defined.
When creating a record only template description, only 1 `<record>` tag can be used.  It is not allowed to include different records in a record only template.

A sample `<vpd>` section would look like this:
``` xml
<vpd>
  <name>simple</name>
  <size>16kb</size>
  <VD>01</VD>
  <record ..>
</vpd>
```
