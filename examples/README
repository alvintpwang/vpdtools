===================

memcard1_ddr3:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR3 memory riser
                  card with a single memory buffer(Centaur).

memcard4_ddr3:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR3 memory riser
                  card with 2 to 4 memory buffer (Centaurs).

memcard1_ddr4:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR4 memory riser
                  card with a single memory buffer(Centaur).

memcard4_ddr4:    This is an example of a VPD template for a DDR4 memory riser
                  card with 2 to 4 memory buffer (Centaurs).

sysplanar:        This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower system
                  planar (aka mother board) that does not have any memory
                  buffer on the card.  A memory riser card will be plugged
                  onto this system planar.

sysplanar32_ddr3: This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower system
                  planar (aka mother board) that has upto 32 memory buffers
                  (Centaurs) on the card.  DDR3 ISDIMMs are plugged onto this
                  system planar.                 

sysplanar32_ddr4: This is an example of a VPD template for an OpenPower system
                  planar (aka mother board) that has upto 32 memory buffers
                  (Centaurs) on the card.   DDR3 ISDIMMs are plugged onto this
                  system planar.

Syntax Examples
===============
bindatainput:     Shows the syntax to have a binary input file for the keyword
                  data

hexwithcomments:  Shows inclusion of comments within hex data for easier reading

rbinfile:         Shows how to include a binary file that contains an entire
                  record.  Can be created using the -r option on createVpd.py

simple:           Most basic syntax example

tworecords:       Shows how to define multiple records within one top level
                  input file
